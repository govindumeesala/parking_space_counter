## 1. Introduction

Urbanization has led to a surge in vehicle ownership, making efficient parking management a critical challenge in commercial zones such as malls, hospitals, and business complexes. Manual supervision of parking lots often results in underutilized spaces, long queues, and poor user experience. This project addresses these challenges by developing an automated computer vision system for parking slot identification and occupancy tracking using overhead camera images. The system aims to provide real-time, accurate insights into slot availability, streamline parking operations, and enable integration with digital displays and mobile applications for enhanced user experience and data-driven infrastructure planning.

Our approach is two-stage:  
1. **Parking Slot Detection** using object detection (YOLOv8) or mask-based localization.  
2. **Occupancy Classification** using ResNet-based classifiers on cropped slot images.

---

## 2. Motivation

Efficient parking management is a pressing need in rapidly urbanizing environments. Automated solutions can significantly reduce congestion, improve user satisfaction, and optimize space utilization. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, our system aims to automate the entire pipeline—from slot detection to occupancy reporting—enabling smarter cities and better infrastructure planning.

## 3. Data Overview

### 3.1 PKLot Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle PKLot dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blanderbuss/parking-lot-dataset)
- **Description:** 12,417 images from three parking lots:
  - **UFPR04 & UFPR05:** Different views (4th & 5th floors) of the same lot at Federal University of Parana (UFPR)
  - **PUCPR:** 10th floor view at Pontifical Catholic University of Parana (PUCPR)
- **Limitation:** Only three camera angles, which impacts model generalization.

### 3.2 Single Slot Classification Dataset

- **Source:** [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CjEFWihRqTLNUnYRwHXxGAVwSXF2k8QC)
- **Description:** 6,000 cropped images of individual parking slots, created for training the ResNet classifier:
  - **3,000 images of empty slots**
  - **3,000 images of occupied slots**
- **Annotation:**  
  - Each slot image is labeled as either "occupied" or "empty".
  - The cropping and labeling process is based on manual or mask-based annotation of the original parking lot images.
  - The annotation process (generating `slots.json` from binary masks) is implemented in the `utils` folder and is used for prediction/inference to locate and extract slots from new images.

## 4. Challenges Faced

### 4.1 Dataset Limitations for YOLO Dynamic Detection

- **Challenge:**  
  While YOLOv8 achieved exceptional performance on the PKLot dataset (99.42% mAP50), the dataset contains images from only three fixed camera angles. This limited variety of viewpoints poses a challenge for real-world deployment where parking lots may have different layouts and camera positions not represented in the training data.
- **Solution:**  
  We developed a two-pronged approach:
  1. YOLOv8 for high-accuracy detection in known configurations
  2. Mask-based approach for robust slot localization in new or unseen viewpoints

### 4.2 Generating Accurate slots.json from Mask Images

- **Challenge:**  
  When generating `slots.json` from binary mask images, many parking spaces were extremely close together. Using contour detection often resulted in merged bounding boxes, making it difficult to separate individual slots accurately.
  **Figure 3:** Merged slots when used cotour detection
  ![Slots from contour detection](./src/detect_classify_count_slots_for_given_img/utils/pk_slots_contours.jpg)

- **Solution:**  
  We switched from contour-based detection to using **connected components analysis** (see [`generate_slots_json.py`](src/detect_classify_count_slots_for_given_img/utils/generate_slots_json.py)), which provided better separation of adjacent slots and improved the accuracy of slot localization.
  **Figure 4:** Exact slots localization by using connected components
  ![Slots from contour detection](./src/detect_classify_count_slots_for_given_img/utils/pk_slots_annotated.jpg)

### 4.3 Imbalanced Slot Crops in Real-World Images

* **Challenge:**
  In certain scenes, some slots never appeared (occluded by poles, cropped out), leading to uneven numbers of empty vs. occupied crop patches during inference demo.
* **Solution:**
  We added a minimum-area filter (`if w*h < threshold: continue`) to discard spurious tiny contours, and updated our inference script to report both the number of detected slots and the number actually classified, making clear any missing or merged slots.

## 5. Workflow

The complete workflow is as follows:

### 5.1 Preprocessing

- **Image Enhancement:**  
  - Applied CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for improved contrast.
  - Denoising filters to reduce noise and improve feature clarity.
- **Annotation Conversion:**  
  - PKLot XML annotations are converted to YOLO format for object detection.
  - For mask-based approach, binary masks are processed to generate `slots.json` containing slot coordinates and status (used for cropping and inference).
- **Slot Cropping:**  
  - Using `slots.json`, each parking slot is cropped from the original image and labeled as occupied or empty for the single-slot dataset.

### 5.2 Model Training

#### YOLOv8 (Detection + Classification)
- Initially, we attempted to dynamically detect and classify parking slots using YOLOv8 trained on the PKLot dataset.
- **Input:** Full parking lot images with YOLO-formatted labels.
- **Augmentations:** Mosaic, mixup, color jitter, random scaling.
- **Training:**  
  - Model: YOLOv8s  
  - Epochs: 100  
  - Optimizer: AdamW  
  - Batch size: 16  
- **Limitation:**  
  - Good at classifying slot occupancy when the slot is correctly detected, but missed many slots in new/unseen views due to limited camera angles in PKLot.

#### ResNet-18 (Slot Classification)
- Due to YOLO's limitations, we adopted a mask-based approach for robust slot localization and classification.
- **Input:** Cropped slot images (from mask-based annotation).
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - Resize to 224x224 pixels.
  - Normalize using ImageNet mean and std.
- **Augmentations (Model B):**  
  - RandomResizedCrop, RandomHorizontalFlip, ColorJitter.
- **Training:**  
  - Model: ResNet-18 pretrained on ImageNet.
  - Optimizer: Adam (lr=1e-4).
  - Loss: CrossEntropyLoss.
  - Batch size: 32.
  - Early stopping (patience=3) for Model B.
- **Validation:**  
  - 20% of data used for validation.
  - Early stopping and checkpointing based on validation accuracy.

  - Consistent performance gains until convergence around epoch 9-10
  - Final model achieved near-perfect detection capabilities on known viewpoints

- **Loss Metrics (Final):**
  - Box Loss: 0.616

The visualization toolkit (src/visualization/plot_training_metrics.py) provides comprehensive performance analysis through three key plots:
- Training loss and validation accuracy comparisons
- Detailed metrics tracking for Model B
- Final performance comparison between approaches

These results highlight an interesting trade-off: while YOLOv8 achieves remarkable accuracy on known viewpoints, the mask-based approach with ResNet classification provides better generalization across different parking lot layouts and camera angles. This insight guided our final system design, combining the strengths of both approaches for robust real-world deployment.

## 9. Discussion

- **Why YOLO Struggled:**  
  - Limited camera angles in PKLot dataset led to poor generalization for slot detection.
- **ResNet Success:**  
  - Mask-based slot annotation and cropping enabled high-accuracy classification.
  - Strong augmentations and early stopping prevented overfitting.
- **Trade-offs:**  
  - Two-stage approach (detection + classification) is more robust for this dataset than end-to-end detection.
